This is where I'll put links to my projects and code samples.

**Unity Demonstrations**

[Bubble Sort](https://jonscott20.github.io/Bubble_Sort/BubbleSort) - Last Updated 12/13/16

Course Work from the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

All of my work done as a student at Cal Poly is covered under a collaboration agreement. 
In order to promote academic honesty, I am only willing to share code samples from the projects when contacted individually.
Project specifications are also availabe upon request.

**Project 2 - Word Count**


**Project 3 - Word Frequency**

**Project 4 - Battleship**

This was by far my favorite project of the class. It was an exercise in using fork, exec in order to create multiple processes and pass information between them via pipes.

The class was then given the opportunity to create a player to compete in a tournament against the rest of the players in the class. Of 105 people in two sections of the class, only around 30 people qualified to compete in the tournament. The image below is how I ranked among those who qualifed. My username is Jscott24, highlighted green. The instructor joined in the fun too - his username was kmammen, highlighted blue.

**Project 5 - C Shell**

**Project 6 - LZW Compression**

The LZW compression algorithm paired with bit packing and recycling with codes between 2^9 and 2^15

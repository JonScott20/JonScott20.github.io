**Description:** 
In order to meet graduatation requirements from Wood River High School, students are required to complete a independent senior project in order to demonstrate their ability to conduct research, explore interesting careers, and learn new skills. I chose to create an iOS application focusing on improving student time management and organization. 

**Approximate Date:** Summer of 2014

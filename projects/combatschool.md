**Combat School**
--------------

**Description:** For the final project in my advanced game design class in high school, I created a simple first person shooter training ground. Really, its quite silly because the projectiles are large red balls that explode on impact, but I had fun making it and experimenting with different components of the genre. The project was created using C# in Unity and some of the art assets were acquired from Unity's asset store. And yes, that is high school me doing all the narration.

**Approximate Date:** Spring of 2015

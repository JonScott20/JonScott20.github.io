**Lights Out**
--------------

**Description:** A friend ([Robert Weber](http://www.rawprogramming.com/#/Home)) and I decided to get together and create an Android game in one night as a challenge. We went from brainstorming to completion in approximately 11 hours. The result was a simple 2D side scroller where the protagonist must jump over the spikes. The catch is that distance that the user can see the upcoming spikes from changes.

**Approximate Date:** November 2016

**LZW Compression**
--------------

**Learning Objectives**

* Learn the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) compression algorithm
* Utilize dynamic byte-packet size in order to improve compression ratios
* Implement a trie data structure and recycling mechanism
* Meet performance and memory standards in comparison to the reference solution

In order to learn the LZW algorithm, I gave the following resources several read throughs and practiced their examples by hand.
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch)
* [LZW Data Compression](http://marknelson.us/1989/10/01/lzw-data-compression/)
* [LZW Revisited](http://marknelson.us/2011/11/08/lzw-revisited/)


**Language Used: C**

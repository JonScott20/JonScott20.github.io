Course Work from the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

All of my code written as a student at Cal Poly is covered under a collaboration agreement. 
In order to promote academic honesty, I am only willing to share code samples from the projects when contacted individually.
Project specifications are also availabe upon request.

Notes taken in class can be found [here.](https://jonscott20.github.io/course_notes/)

Major related classes I'm taking next quarter can be found [here.](https://jonscott20.github.io/future_classes/)

Course Work from the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

All of my code written as a student at Cal Poly is covered under a collaboration agreement. 
In order to promote academic honesty, I am only willing to share code samples from the projects when contacted individually.
Project specifications are also availabe upon request.

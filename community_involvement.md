### LoveSlo March 18, 2017

**Volunteer Posting:** CL Smith Elementary has a commemorative brick walkway in the front of our school. The engraved bricks were purchased to recognize both students and staff members. Construction on campus necessitated the removal of the bricks, and they are currently being stored. We would like to recreate the walkway in a bare patch of soil at the entrance to our multi-purpose room to beautify the area. We are looking for Love SLO Volunteers to install the pathway and make our MR entrance inviting to all who enter.

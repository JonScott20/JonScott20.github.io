### LoveSlo Citywide Community Service Event

![LoveSlo](https://jonscott20.github.io/Files/Images/LoveSloCLSmithElementary.jpg)

**Date of Event:** March 19, 2017

**Volunteer Posting:** CL Smith Elementary has a commemorative brick walkway in the front of our school. The engraved bricks were purchased to recognize both students and staff members. Construction on campus necessitated the removal of the bricks, and they are currently being stored. We would like to recreate the walkway in a bare patch of soil at the entrance to our multi-purpose room to beautify the area. We are looking for Love SLO Volunteers to install the pathway and make our MR entrance inviting to all who enter.

**Dates of Event:** September 18 - 24, 2016

**Description:**
Cal Poly's Week of Welcome (WOW) takes place a week before classes begin in the Fall. Previous students volunteer to lead a group of ten to fifteen students and introduce them to life at Cal Poly. The goal of the program is to introduce the new students to the local community, foster a social atmosphere in order to build strong relationships, and become educated about the various topics and issues that may be encountered while attending the university. 

In order to participate as a WOW leader, students are required to attend a 10 week training program during the spring quarter prior to event. During this time, potential leaders develop their leadership skills, plan the recreational programming for the week, and learn about the various resources available on Cal Poly's campus. Leaders are taught techniques on how to be inclusive and on how to facilitate discussion on tough topics such as mental health, substance abuse, and healthy relationships.

**Date of Event:** September 17, 2016

**Description:**
Moving into Cal Poly was notoriously quite a pain. In the image above, myself and my co-leader (from WOW) volunteered to help move incoming freshmen into their respective residence halls. Both the students and parents greatly appreciated our efforts. We were happy to make a friendly first impression and welcome the new students to their new communities.

In this specific instance, a small group and I were given the task of locating a underground leaking irrigation pipe.

### Romanesco Gleaning

**Date of Event:** May 2016

**Description:**
When local farms have extra produce that they decide not to harvest, they call in GleanSLO in order to prevent the food from going to waste. Volunteers with GleanSLO provide the labor to harvest the extra produce and the "gleaned" items are donated directly to the SLO food bank. The volunteer events are good opportunities to get outside, pick some plants, and know that the service is responsible for helping to feed those in need. Sometimes volunteers are even allowed to take a small bag of the harvest home with them too.

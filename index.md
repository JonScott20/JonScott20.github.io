I'm a computer science student born and raised in the state of Idaho. I choose to pursue a higher education at Cal Poly for its reputable computer science program.

My first "Hello World" program was when I was a freshman in high school in an elective course I choose to take on a whim. For my senior project, I created an organizational application for the iPad that I called the "DigiGenda."

I enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it be hiking, swimming, or skiing. I spent a considerable amount of time playing sports in high school, primarily soccer and basketball, where I learned the value of being both a good leader and good follower.

One of my "adult" goals is to adopt a canine companion. I'm currently torn between a Golden Retriever and a German Shepherd. 

I don't have the desire to end up working in some dream location, I very much feel comfortable with the idea of living anywhere.

One day I hope fulfill my childhood dream of flying and obtain my pilot's license.
